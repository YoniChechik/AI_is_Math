# EX4a: Vignetting
# In photography and optics, vignettingâ€‚is a reduction of an
# image's brightness or saturation toward the periphery compared
# to the image center.
#
# Mechanical vignetting (for example) occurs when light beams emanating from
# object points located off-axis are partially blocked by
# external objects such as thick or stacked filters, secondary
# lenses, and improper lens hoods. [Wikipedia]

#
# You are an algorithm engineer in a new cutting-edge camera
# startup with a new problem of automatically correct vignetting problems.

# The simple approach:
# Getting a calibration image of a white wall and then simply divide this calib_im with each raw image to get a fixed image.
# The problem:
# Not enough memory in the camera to save multiple calib images per each lens configuration.
#
# The New process the we propose is as follows:
# 1. For each new lens the end-user wants to use, he will shoot one calibration image of a white wall.
# 2. Calibration params are saved for this lens configuration.
# 3. The user can now work with this lens configuration and the vignetting will be corrected for all images.

# Behind the scenes we need to build 3 functions:
# 1. `get_index_matrix()` that returns the
# index matrix (called `X` in our lesson). We will build this in python but our engineers will convert it to ASIC,
# so this function CAN'T change.
# 2. `get_calib_coeffs(calib_map)` that gets a raw image of the white wall and returns the betta vector (the calibration params).
# 3. `fix_raw_im(b, vig_im)` that gets the user image and the betta vector and fixes the image vignetting.
# It reconstruct the calib image input from (2) using (1) + betta vector and then divide the input image with this reconstructed calib_map to get a fixed image.
